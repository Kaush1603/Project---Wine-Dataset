#Loadings/scores for the Principal Components
#The loadings for the principal components are stored in a named element "rotation" of the variable returned by
# "prcomp()"

#This contains a matrix with the loadings of each principal component, where the first column in the
#matrix contains the loadings for the first principal component, the second column contains the loadings for the
#second principal component, and so on.

wine.pca$rotation[,1:3]

#    values of the first principal component are stored in the variable wine.pca$x[,1] that was returned by
#    the "prcomp()" function

wine.pca$x[,1]

#The first principal component has highest (in absolute value) loadings for (Variables = V1,V2...V14) V1(0.393), V7 (-0.359), V8 (-0.390),
#V13 (-0.350), V10 (-0.279), V9(0.2267),V12(-0.27), V14 (-0.269), V3 (0.222), and V5 (0.224). The loadings for V8, V7,
#V13, V10, V12 and V14 are negative, while those for V9, V3, and V5 are positive. Therefore, an interpretation
#of the first principal component is that it represents a contrast between the concentrations of V8, V7, V13, V10,
#V12, and V14, and the concentrations of V9, V3 and V5.



#Scatterplots of the Principal Components


#scatterplot of the first two principal components
plot(wine.pca$x[,1],wine.pca$x[,2]) # make a scatterplot
text(wine.pca$x[,1],wine.pca$x[,2], wine$Class, cex=0.7, pos=4, col="red")

#The scatterplot shows the first principal component on the x-axis, and the second principal component on the yaxis.
#We can see from the scatterplot that wine samples of cultivar 1 have much lower values of the first principal
#component than wine samples of cultivar 3. Therefore, the first principal component separates wine samples of
#cultivars 1 from those of cultivar 3.
#We can also see that wine samples of cultivar 2 have much higher values of the second principal component than
#wine samples of cultivars 1 and 3. Therefore, the second principal component separates samples of cultivar 2 from
#samples of cultivars 1 and 3.
#Therefore, the first two principal components are reasonably useful for distinguishing wine samples of the three
#different cultivars.
